# Lightbery
Lightbery (pronounced "light berry") is a platform for managing your favorite artworks across different platforms. We allow users to create collections to manage and share their favorite artworks. We started at December 2023 and is **STILL IN DEVELOPMENT** due to the developer(~~s~~) keep rewriting the codebaseâ„¢.

> [!Note]
> Lightbery itself is not open source, but we had open sourced some tools that Lightbery uses.

## Fun Facts
* The frontend and the backend of Lightbery can get bundled into one single JavaScript file.
* The whole codebase only uses 1 npm package (not including `devDependencies`).
